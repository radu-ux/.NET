Project Status:
-main view of the application was designed 
(it contains some cards describing each Dorm and a button that displays more info about the selected dorm)
-dorms.json file contains information regarding each dorm.
-dorm page design started.

OBS: - as dorm.json is fetch over HTTP GET Request, for the app to see it, it needs to be stored on desktop.
     - the server used to serve the file is a simple http server started with the python command (python -m http.server).

Future work:
-finish dorm page design.
-create user accounts to book a place in a dorm.
